        The button below will verify if a section of the website is visibile or not.<br/>
        If it is not, the action of pressing the button will modify the status (True, or False).<br/>
        The button will function as a toggle element applying modification to the DOM of the website as to make it appear or disapear.
    </p>

    <!-- Element that will serve as a way to modify the state of an element at the action of the visitor -->
    <button id="toggle-button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="toggle">Show</button>

    <!-- Hidden part when first loading, state change when clicking the button -->

    <section id="toggle" hidden>
        <h2>It was meant to be hidden...</h2>
        <p>
            You've awaken a secret that none shall have laid eyes upon.<br> Are you sure that summoning that button capacity was the right thing to do ?

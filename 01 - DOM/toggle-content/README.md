## Objectives :

- Being able to modify the DOM of a website
- Doing so by playing with the state of an element
- Modifying the state of said element by an interaction with the user.

## Concepts :

The page has a single title, a paragraph inviting the user to click on the button, and the button itself.
When the user clicks the button, a hidden section is shown.
Clicking the button again hides the section.
The button label reflects the action it will perform.

## What I learned :

- How to focus on a state instead of reloading the DOM for each iteration.
- The function variable.toString()
- How the aria-expanded and aria-controls tags work

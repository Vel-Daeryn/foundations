# Tabs
## Objectives

- Managing multiple interactive elements
- Identifying the correct element that triggered an event
- Creating a clear relationship between UI elements and their associated content


## Concepts

Three buttons act as tabs, each associated with a text panel.
When a tab is clicked, its associated content is displayed while the others are hidden.
Accessibility-related attributes are updated accordingly (aria-selected, etc.).

## What I learned

- Event delegation
- Structuring event handling in a scalable way
- Accessibility best practices for tab-based interfaces

## Possible improvements

- Being more specific when selecting elements to ensure robustness in more complex layouts with multiple similar components.

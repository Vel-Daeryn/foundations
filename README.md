# Foundations

This repository is a personal learning hub focused on strengthening front-end fundamentals.

The goal is not to build showcase projects, but to deeply understand core concepts
through small, focused, and well-documented mini-projects.

## Objectives

- Reinforce JavaScript fundamentals (Vanilla JS)
- Build a strong understanding of DOM, events, state, async logic, and accessibility
- Practice structuring code clearly and maintainably
- Learn to explain technical decisions and trade-offs

## Repository Structure

Each folder represents a core front-end topic.
Inside each topic, mini-projects focus on a single concept or problem.

Each mini-project contains its own README explaining:
- the objective
- the concepts involved
- what was implemented
- possible improvements

## Philosophy

- Small and focused projects
- One main concept at a time
- Code clarity over cleverness
- Learning-driven, not performance-driven

This repository evolves as my understanding grows.

### Practice is the way to grow.
